  Leaders and Professionals often get so much caught up in run of the mill
  affairs that the focus on change and doing meaningful tasks is misplaced.
  That’s the time when someone from somewhere behind the boardrooms is watching
  you.

**Leaders and 
Professionals often get so much caught up in run of the mill affairs 
that the focus on change and doing meaningful tasks is misplaced. That’s
 the time when someone from somewhere behind the boardrooms is watching 
you.**

When the best friend of mine approached me amid the most common dilemma of workplace ***“The creativity and Innovation Jinx”***,
 he told me that the feedback he got about his performance was 
“Excellent” but still not up to what is expected out of him…he felt lost
 in the maze of work and actually did not know where his 40 hours of the
 week were being burnt…..

The simple advice for him was, to take a break, rediscover himself and comeback to work with ***enhanced value***.

If
 you think you are working hard and are on the top of things…it may be a
 myth…Leadership is expected to drive change, bring innovation, build 
passion and many more invisible value additions to the organization 
which do not find any readymade solution in any management book….

While not losing control over the ***“business as usual”,***
 there is much more which is actually being monitored, watched and 
expected..….the point is being noted by someone somewhere and by 
everyone everywhere.

The simple possible formula to bring you out of this jinx is to keep **“business as usual”** objectives and **“value addition”**
 objectives separate from each other and define them well in your 
performance Objectives. Incidentally most of us do have well defined BAU
 objectives but very few of us may have 2 or 3 VA objectives. ***Define
 your planned stay of next 3 years in the organization in 10 distinct 
value add and change objectives that you want to see coming through***.
 This way you will have clarity of thought, direction and action and 
also at the end of the term will have added significant value to the 
organization. This work should be something, which you would be 
remembered for in the organization.

***The value has to be a real value, either for its customers, or for the employees or for the management processes and systems***.
 There is no need to create a list of projects and make lives miserable 
for cross functional project teams by creating a deadline/timeline 
calendar. There is also no need to prove yourself a *“Creativity genius”.* The
 simple and the best ways are to look at the Vision and direction of the
 organization and to pick up projects or assignment for which the 
organization has a vision to achieve. Leadership and project management 
are always good qualities that may highlight you personally, but at the 
same time being a team worker and key contributor is also equally 
noticeable.

Always remember someone in the organization always 
knows what to look for and most of the time it catches you unawares… be 
ready explore your existence, challenge the status quo and add 
measurable Value.
