**More and more organizations today are adopting themselves into a matrix structure to answer the need of agility in responding to customers and using subject matter expertise.**

**“Unity of Command”**….
 So is the principle of Henri Fayol since 1916…..98 years on… the concepts of management still stand true and seem to be looking much beyond their literal historical meaning?

A matrix organization focuses on the collective performance and delivery, at the same time needs sharp focus on the individual performances and behaviors. A common performance matrix, SMART and transparent individual Objectives, equal focus on behaviors and competencies, individual behavior feedback tools and organization wide combined career and potential review are some of the tools that the management teams should sit together and work upon.

***What works best…fails worst too***, the difference lies in people and the dynamics of the teams. The 
challenge demands the Executive Leadership teams and HR professionals to add a new edge of ***understanding the positive and hampering behaviors of the organization.***

**Lack of Ownership** and **accountability**, **passing of buck**, **pushing the mails**, **ego centricity**, **what if attitude**, **inability to add immediate value, missing the urgency** and **political God fathering** are some of the **unforgivable sins** in a Matrix structure.

If not handled correctly the matrix organization can provide enough scope and ground to play around with the human dynamics. In the famous Indian epic of ***“Mahabharata”*** the game of “***Chousar” **which was the ignition point of famous war** was also a Matrix**… (Humor and meaning both intended).*

**Self-Driven Individuals**, respect for **Interdependence, ego less** behaviors and **attitude to resolve** are the key behaviors to look for in a matrix organization. Time tested qualities of **Teamwork and Collaboration** find much more importance than ever in such structures. Values like **Trust, Respect and Integrity** attain much more significance.

Missing of any one of the positive behaviors or presence of any one of the hampering behavior are enough to make your organization a battle ground. The role of the HR Professionals is to attain a position from where they can gain a bird’s eye view of the organization and watch the interplay and monitor the dynamics. A timely action to eliminate a hampering behavior and continuous efforts to encourage the promoter 
behaviors are required on a constant basis.

Today the need of the hour is the HR professionals with qualities to lead the executive leadership teams which are able to equally visualize the performances and behavior patterns.

***It’s not easy for a HR professional to attain that place and obtain that space, it takes a lot if the finer innate sense of observation, perseverance, courage and confidence to reach to that place.***
