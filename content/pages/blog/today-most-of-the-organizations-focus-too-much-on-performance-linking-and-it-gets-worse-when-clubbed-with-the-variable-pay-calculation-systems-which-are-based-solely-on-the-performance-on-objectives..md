From periodicity of process, to the subjectivity of objectives, the brutal bell curve and bias of the managers in making the assessment… Everything that a Performance Management System should have is a 
subject of debate…

More often than ever the Human Resource Managers are busy in responding, explaining, and coaching for the 
performance management to the employees, managers and the directors… and as usual at the backstage with HR fraternity discussing and debating on what is it, what it should be, and why it should be.

These debates range from the periodicity of the process, to the subjectivity of the objectivity, objectivity of the assessor, bias of the angle and the bell curve*…(the inverse image of which looks more like a hanging rope....humor meant at the cost of your bubbling emotions).*

I actually don’t have enough grey hair to understand if these discussions have happened since ages. To me they still sound quite young and interesting.

A few discussions at various forums which caught my attention were:

**Periodicity of review:** Discussions around Annual versus the quarterly reviews

**De-linking of Performance Ratings from payouts:** use them as development tools only without any impact on payouts.

**Eliminating bias:** of the manager and assessment of subjective areas with a link to angular stakeholder feedback.

**Point no 1 and 2 sounded new to me** hence would love to get the thoughts and views of readers on this. And I 
express my own views with a disclaimer and due respect to all existing HR processes that the organizations follow.

*What is the right periodicity of a review? Answer of this depends on what results managers want to draw out of the review discussions…what is the fruitfulness… Or it’s just another HR process for which you are receiving hateful system generated reminders as a manager…*

What is the point in doing a review when the year has already gone by… referring the process more as a ***ghost chase***…and believe me this ghost has capacity to give sleepless nights to many who actually fall on the other end of the rope of bell curve…. spoiling their happiness and sometimes lives too..

So, what is the right periodicity… The answer lies in the autonomy of the role, extent of supervision, impact on stakeholders and opportunity to take corrective action…***the challenge for HR managers is, not to develop one more template but to make a process which actually enhances performance. The entire paradigm needs to shift to a Performance Enhancement System in place of a performance management system.***

One more question which I often ask managers is…who determines the periodicity of review…in my view periodicity of review is something which every manager should decide and it should not be dependent on the 
fixed timetables. Though organization may have processes and mandates to ensure consistency. And actually many of the good people managers do practice periodic reviews for enhancement of the performances. ***The most important role for HR managers is to build such people managers.***

**On point no 2 of de-linking the Performance Management System from payouts:** Some managers view payouts more as a function of market compensation pattern, criticality of role, attrition risk and potential to act as 
carrot. Some others view it as a reward directly linked to performance.

Today, the industry has a mix of practice and drawing firm boundaries between two schools of thoughts is not easy, but while reading this you actually know, which side of the fence your organization stands. Merit matrix and incentive payouts today have direct links with the performance and market benchmarks, what makes the difference is the fragrance which is often lost in the process.

***I tend to put this at the cost of sounding weird ....but why not have differential payment system where the results lead to incentives and Potential to organization and relative market positioning leads to salary increment..…***today most of the organizations focus too much on performance linking and it gets worse when clubbed with the variable pay calculation systems which are based solely on the performance on objectives. Practically the weightage on potential and the “How” part of the job is only fractional even in the best of performance potential metrics the overall weightage when seen along with the variable/performance pay would not be more than
 30% .

This would mean that an excellent potential guy would also get market level salary increment even if his actual performance for that period is been poor.

The objective is not to reward a poor performer, but for sure to keep a **Hi Potential,** still maintaining his self-respect and trust in his future potential. More important if the under performance is due to external factors. This will help managers to look at bell curve more constructively and differentiate performances and rewards.

*The best a HR manager can do is, to build a performance culture which values human effort and potential, rewards performances and enhances productivity by timely reviews that add value for the organization and people.*
