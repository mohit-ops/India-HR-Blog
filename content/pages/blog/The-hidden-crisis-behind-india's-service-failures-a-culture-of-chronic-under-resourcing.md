*India’s airlines may be making headlines, but the real turbulence is deeper and shared across industries that are quietly running on dangerously thin staffing, broken assumptions, and a belief that people can
absorb endless pressure.*

The airline disruptions have invited a flurry of surface level
explanations; regulatory interventions, grounded aircraft, supply
chain bottlenecks. But these are merely the sparks that lit a system
already soaked in gasoline. The crisis in aviation is not an aviation
crisis at all. It is a symptom of a deeper structural disorder that
has been building for years across multiple industries.

While much has happened and regulators have assured return to normally,
they have also been on back foot amending and partly revoking an
order which they had introduced almost 24 months back providing for a
time bound roll out in18-24 months.

Having
observed the same patterns in manufacturing, IT services, customer
operations, healthcare, engineering and EPC firms, retail networks,
and even financial services, it is evident that the root cause is not
operational complexity. It is a mindset problem, a management
philosophy of reducing resources to the bare minimum and expecting
people and systems to somehow carry the weight indefinitely.

When
“Lean” Becomes Lethal

Corporate
India has long celebrated efficiency, optimization, and “lean
operations.” In theory, these principles eliminate waste. In
practice, they have mutated into a strategy of aggressive under
resourcing. Many organizations now run with:


	
	
	
	

What
looks mathematically efficient in boardrooms often collapses under
real world complexity. Spreadsheets do not carry fatigue. Dashboards
do not absorb stress. People do.

And
when people break, customers feel the consequences.







Minimum
Staffing, Maximum Risk

Leadership
teams often talk about manpower planning failures or slow hiring
pipelines. But the uncomfortable truth is simpler: many businesses
are not even attempting to staff optimally; they are staffing
minimally.

The
pressure to keep COGS and COSS as low as possible leads companies to
operate at personnel levels that look efficient quarterly but are
unsustainable annually. The result is a silent extraction economy,
where profitability is boosted not through innovation but by
stretching employees beyond reasonable limits.

Employees
end up:


	
	
	
	

Meanwhile,
customers encounter long queues, delayed services, poorly informed
staff, unmet commitments, and declining reliability.

In
chasing margin, companies slowly erode the very trust that sustains
long term profitability.

The
Growth Paradox: High Demand, Low Accountability

India
is a growth economy. Demand is rising faster than supply in aviation,
healthcare, real estate, logistics, digital commerce, and essential
services. When demand is guaranteed, the incentive to invest in
service quality weakens. Companies believe customers have limited
alternatives, and therefore reliability can slip without immediate
consequence.

But
this creates a dangerous complacency: as long as the consumer keeps
coming back, the system does not feel compelled to reform.

However,
growth without quality is a fragile foundation; especially for a
nation with aspirations of becoming a developed economy by 2047. A
world class economy cannot run on understaffed hospitals, overworked
airline crews, exhausted IT teams, or overstretched infrastructure
operators.



















India’s
Hidden Crisis Is a Workforce Crisis

Across
sectors, the message is consistent: the system is running hot. Too
hot.

Aviation
crews working beyond safe limits. Customer service agents handling
impossible volumes. Delivery personnel facing unsustainable targets.
Engineers racing deadlines with no buffer. Healthcare workers
navigate patient loads that compromise care.

These
are not one-off lapses; they are the predictable outcomes of an
economic model that treats manpower as a cost to be minimized, not a
capability to be strengthened.

What
Needs to Change

India
does not need firefighting; it needs structural correction. Five
shifts are essential:


	
	
	
	
	

The
Way Forward

India
stands at an inflection point. Our economy is growing, our ambitions
are rising, and our consumers are becoming more discerning. To
sustain this trajectory, we must confront an uncomfortable truth:
chronic under resourcing is not efficient, it is reckless. It weakens
service quality, damages brand trust, and ultimately threatens the
economic momentum we celebrate.

The
airline crisis is simply the warning light on the dashboard. The real
engine problem lies deeper. If India wants world class industries, it
must start by building world class capacity, human, operational, and
organizational. Efficiency is important, but resilience is
indispensable.
